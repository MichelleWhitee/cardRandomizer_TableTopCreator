# Card randomizer for Table Top Creator
Is used for randomize card CSV - files, or for other csv files if you need to randomize them.
I wanted to create an application for shuffling cards to generate new sets and print randomly arranged cards in a PDF.

To start, you need to place the necessary files in the "CSV_files" folder, which you can access from the interface by clicking the folder icon button.
**Note:** If you've launched the application and only then placed files into the folder, you need to press the "Refresh" button next to the text field. It's in this text field that the list of files in the folder will be displayed.

The output files will be generated in the "output_CSV" folder, which you can also open by clicking the folder icon button with an arrow.

The two main functions of the application are:
*1)* Shuffling rows in all source files and creating modified copies of them (**left button**).
*2)* Shuffling the source files with splitting them into segments with a specific, customizable step (**right button**).


Optionally, you can select a theme from the toolbar.
Currently, there are both **light** and **dark** themes available, as well as... a **pink** one?


### And that's the entire application! It's VERY specific in its scope, but hey, you can shuffle CSV files *:D*
